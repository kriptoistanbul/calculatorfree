            <h2>Understanding Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</h2>
            <p>
                Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to maintain basic physiological functions while at rest. These functions include breathing, circulation, cell production, nutrient processing, and temperature regulation. Essentially, BMR represents the energy required to keep your body functioning when you are not engaged in any physical activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding your BMR is fundamental for managing your weight and overall health. By knowing your BMR, you can tailor your diet and exercise routines to meet your specific energy needs, whether your goal is to lose weight, gain muscle, or maintain your current weight.
            </p>
            
            <h3>How is BMR Calculated?</h3>
            <p>
                BMR is calculated using several factors, including your age, gender, weight, height, and body composition. The most commonly used equations to estimate BMR are the Harris-Benedict Equation and the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation. These formulas provide an estimate of the number of calories your body needs at rest.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Harris-Benedict Equation:</strong> One of the earliest and most widely used BMR equations.</li>
                <li><strong>Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:</strong> Considered more accurate for modern populations, especially for those with varying body compositions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our advanced BMR Calculator utilizes the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation to provide a more precise estimation of your BMR.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Factors Affecting BMR</h3>
            <p>
                Several factors influence your BMR, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> BMR typically decreases with age due to a loss of lean muscle mass.</li>
                <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Males generally have a higher BMR than females because of higher muscle mass and lower body fat percentages.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight and Height:</strong> Larger individuals with more body mass have higher BMRs.</li>
                <li><strong>Body Composition:</strong> Individuals with higher muscle mass have higher BMRs.</li>
                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Genetic factors can influence metabolic rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Hormonal Levels:</strong> Hormones like thyroid hormones play a significant role in regulating metabolism.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Extreme temperatures can increase BMR as the body works to maintain its core temperature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By considering these factors, our advanced BMR Calculator provides a personalized estimation of your basal metabolic rate.
            </p>
            
            <h3>BMR vs. TDEE</h3>
            <p>
                While BMR is the number of calories your body needs at rest, Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) encompasses all the calories you burn in a day, including physical activities and digestion. Understanding both BMR and TDEE is essential for effective weight management.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BMR:</strong> Basal Metabolic Rate - Calories burned at rest.</li>
                <li><strong>TDEE:</strong> Total Daily Energy Expenditure - BMR multiplied by an activity factor.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our calculator not only estimates your BMR but also provides your TDEE based on your selected activity level, offering a comprehensive view of your daily caloric needs.
            </p>
